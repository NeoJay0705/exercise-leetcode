# Recursive v.s. Iterative
If data structures used in your function are linkedlisted type not array types, using iterative to avoid uncertain length of your data to make stack overflow.

But your data structures are array type, if using iterative, you have to create objects for each position. Furthermore, using recursive just assigns other indexes to the recursive function. Otherwise, the length of data are visible.
